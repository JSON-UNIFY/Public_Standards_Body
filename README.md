# 2023 JSON-Unify Public Standards Steering Committee

### The public standards body repository for the JSON-Unify specification is currently a group of data enthusiasts to move the industry forward in more efficiently and effectively using data. We are working towards JSON-Unify becoming an official part of the JSON-Schema specification.

The three most valuable amd fundamental problems to solve in data management are searching for the location of data, searching within data for analytical purposes, and minimizing entropy / ambiguity. There are a lot of solutions out there, and yet somehow, this problem is yet not solved. JSON-Unify is a specification focused on parsimony, *the absolute bare minimal cost of time and complexity* that can *improve the developer experience*.

Metadata enables searching for data, schema of concepts enable searching within data, and containing the data, meta-data, and concept/schematic data all in one singular object minimizes entropy. When a developer looks at a JSON-Unify dataset, they can immediately get data about the data, what's in the data, guaranteed (contract) to be one signular object.

These very simple rules can be implemented in any system and any language, maximizing the ability for adoption and minimizing friction, and this simple data contract enables apps, tools, and business logic to share the same frame of reference.

We are currently working on expanding our Public Standards Steering Committee to make JSON-Unify inclusive of any industry in any domain of knowledge, as easy and simple as possible to begin creating business value.
